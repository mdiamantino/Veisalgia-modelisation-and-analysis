# Implementation and analysis of Veisalgia models
## Description
Veisalgia, also commonly called “Hangover” is a medical condition for the disagreeable physical effects following excessive consumption of alcohol. Headache, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea are only some of the symptoms that could be caused. Given these points, it is useful to study the average response that our body undertakes to counterbalance those physical effects and start a process of elimination of the alcohol.  

Within this context, here we study two models that have been developed in order to analyze the dynamics of this process: 
 - The model of Wagner (*André Heck et al. Getting drunk and sober again.Modelling in Physics and Physics Education, ElectronicProceedings of GIREP, 2006.*)
 - The model of Norberg  (*Å Norberg, J Gabrielsson, A Wayne Jones, and RG Hahn.   Within-and between-subject variations inpharmacokinetic parameters of ethanol by analysis of breath, venous blood and urine.British journalof clinical pharmacology, 49(5) :399–408, 2000.*)
